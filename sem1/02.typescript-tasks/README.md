# Angular Developer
TypeScript workshop

## Env setup
### Install TypeScript
```bash
$ npm install -g typescript
```
### Verify that ts was installed properly
```bash
$ tsc -v
```
Expected output:
```bash
[chrystian@chrumix 02.typescript-tasks]$ tsc
Version 5.3.2
```
If you see something like that then we have a go.

## How to work with tasks
* Go to directory with the task (first task for example)
```
$ cd 1
```
* Run TypeScript compiler
```
$ tsc
```
* Check errors in the console and fix them, rerun TypeScript compiler

## Goal
Make TypeScript Compiler (tsc) happy - compilation should not report any errors

**IMPORTANT!**
There might be additional tasks/instructions in each task
